# Why?

* With our busy schedule and so many tasks piling on, its easy to just forget about some things. So this app will aim to allow us to see what all tasks are remaining.
* Write about every place you ever wanted to visit and every place you already did. This will help you motivate to travel and explore more.
* Wanted to travel to a new city, have a lot of places to go but finding it hard to keep track.`JustList` is to the rescue.
* Ever happened like you went to the Store and forgot what you have to buy. Never again with `JustList`.

# How?

You create a user, add in the respective lists what you have to do, mark them complete when you are done and edit or remove them as and when you want. LETS MAKE LIFE A BIT SIMPLER :)
