# React-WS
React application for the workshop

# To-DO Application
A React Web App to create a to-do, mark it as done, edit and delete it.

# Why?
With our busy schedule and so many tasks piling on, its easy to just forget about some things. So this app will aim to allow us to see what all tasks are remaining.

# How?
You create a user, add the to-do's you have to do, mark them complete when you are done and edit or remove them as and when you want. LETS MAKE LIFE A BIT SIMPLER :)
